# Cat-VS-Dog-Classification



#Keras Tensorboard Callback function has been implemented
#An insight about optimization has been provided #No. of dense layers, no. of CNN layers and layer sizes have been varied to analyze their effect on model acuracy
#As the model is being trained, accuracy and loss vs epoch variation can be visualized by Tensorboard


#Method: Information about Tensorbaord: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/TensorBoard?version=stable

#During training, write tensorboard --logdir=logs/ on the command prompt (in current directory). Then, a web link will appear. Copy and paste that link in the web Brower to see Tensorboard results.
